The character in the game is customizable by the Player. Player can insert [Name] and [Gender] etc. So the Main Characters name
and such isn't needed unless it's a orphaned type story where the main character was put in a orphanage and his original name lost.
Theres many types of the Orphanaged type story. 
The Main Character starts with a intro type thing which we can set as a [Tutorial] based item or such. 

We can also have a Theorys hidden inside the games story for certain side characters of our choosing. 



We can insert Monster or Enemy Ideas Here: 

The Great List of Names: (Insert As Many names as possible below for side characters if we choose) (We probably aren't going to 
use all of them)
